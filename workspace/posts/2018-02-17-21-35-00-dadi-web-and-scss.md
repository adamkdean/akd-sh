One of the many great things about DADI Web is how easy it is to plug in [middleware](https://docs.dadi.tech/web#middleware), such as the following SCSS preprocessor (based on [node-sass-middleware](https://github.com/sass/node-sass-middleware)) which takes any request with `prefix`, in this case `/css`, and compiles it's counterpart from the `src` directory into the `dest` directory before serving it up.

All you need to do is drop this file into your `workspace/middleware` directory and make sure the paths are correct.

```js
const sassMiddleware = require('node-sass-middleware')
const path = require('path')
const workdir = process.cwd()

const Middleware = function (app) {
  app.use(sassMiddleware({
    src: path.join(workdir, 'workspace', 'public', 'scss'),
    dest: path.join(workdir, 'workspace', 'public', 'css'),
    prefix: '/css',
    outputStyle: 'compressed',
    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  }))
}

module.exports = function (app) {
  return new Middleware(app)
}

module.exports.Middleware = Middleware
```
